BREAKOUT
========

## Goal
Simple implementation of the game Breakout, in C++.


## Implementation
Each game object shall have a dedicated class:
- bar: position, size
- ball: position, size, direction, speed
- blocks: position, size
- map: contains every instanciated objects
The game behavior shall be the following: at update step of the main loop,
collision between objects will be checked, thus updating the state: present
blocks, blocks attributes, bar position...


## Build
From the root of the project, simply use _make_ , and _./breakout_ to
respectively build and launch the game.
Use the arrows to move the bar, or the A, D keys.
